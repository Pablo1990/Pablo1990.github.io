- Hey newbie! Would you please introduce yourself?<br/>
- Hi! Sure! My name is Pablo and I love programming and help people or environment.<br/>
- Mmmm, so why bioinformatics then? And not programming + help people/environment blog?<br/>
- Hahaha, yeah! That's an easy one. Since I'm a computer scientist, I want to view things from that point of view. So, my duties will be mainly think and try to solve through (mainly) programming, biological problem.<br/>
- And the helping people thing?<br/>
- Oh that! I chose biology for that reason.<br/>
- Did you?<br/>
- Yeahp, biology focus, at the end of the day, in those kind of tasks: help people and/or environment. Well, <i>a priori</i>. <br/>
- That makes sense, <i>a priori</i>, hahaha.<br/>
- Yes, well, at least, I hope it does.<br/>
- Anyway, any final message to your future audience?
- Well,

I hope this blog will be consistent with its opinions and help other people out to answer their questions about bioinformatics or computational biology. 
<br/>
I will also try to post once per fortnight, at least.
